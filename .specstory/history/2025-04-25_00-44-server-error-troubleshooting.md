how do i fix this error on running my server?

_**Assistant**_

I notice you haven't shared the specific error you're encountering when running your server. To help you fix it, I'll need to know:

1. What error message you're seeing
2. What command you're using to run the server

From the context, I can see you have a Next.js project in the `client` directory. The standard way to run a Next.js development server is to:

1. Navigate to the client directory
2. Run `npm run dev`

Let me check if there are any potential issues in your project setup.

| Name |
|-------|
| 📁 `src` |
| 📄 `package-lock.json` |
| 📄 `package.json` |
| 📁 `node_modules` |
| 📁 `.git` |
| 📄 `next.config.ts` |
| 📁 `public` |
| 📄 `tsconfig.json` |
| 📄 `.gitignore` |
| 📄 `README.md` |
| 📄 `eslint.config.mjs` |
| 📄 `next-env.d.ts` |

</details>

---

I notice you have a `next.config.ts` file, which is unusual - Next.js typically uses `next.config.js` or `next.config.mjs`. This could potentially cause issues. Let me check its contents:



---

Read file: client/next.config.ts

---

I found the issue! The problem is that you're using a TypeScript file (`next.config.ts`) for your Next.js configuration, but Next.js expects a JavaScript configuration file. Let's fix this by renaming and converting it to the correct format.

I'll help you fix this by:
1. Deleting the TypeScript config file
2. Creating a proper JavaScript config file

First, let's delete the TypeScript config:


---

undefined

---

Now, let's create the proper JavaScript config file:



---

```diff
- 
+ /** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
+ const nextConfig = {
+   /* config options here */
+ };
+ 
+ module.exports = nextConfig; 
```

---

Now you should be able to run your Next.js server without issues. Try running:

```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

If you're still encountering an error, please share the specific error message you're seeing and I'll help you resolve it.
