Player Mechanics & Movement:
There is no death condition for intersecting a trail.
there is no max length for a trail.
the speed shall be constant with no mechanics to change it.
when a player dies (disconnects) their territory should become neutral

Territory & Scoring:
The trail shall become part of their area yes.
Yes, players can move through any area.
All portions of the map will start off as neutral when the game starts. however any part of the map can become claimed territory.
the only indicator of territory ownership is color.

Game Flow & Sessions:
The win condition of the game is owning the full map.
players shall be able to join mid game. spawning into a random position, with no owned territory.
The game should currently support up to 10 concurrent players, but we shall not limit this arbitrarily.
There shall be a single global arena

Technical Considerations:
We will not go to any efforts to handle a poor network on the players end.
There will be no collision prediction as of yet.
The game shall be desktop only, on the browser
No anti cheat measures.

Visual & UI Elements:
No power ups.
No visual effects when territory is captured
There shall be a minimap yes.
There shall be a leaderboard in the top right, based on the % of territory owned.

Game Persistence:
No player statistics
No account system, players shall get assigned a randomly generated username, unique to the current lobby
No replay system

Technical Stack & Architecture:
We shall use react with nextjs to simply the frontend and backend communication and deployment.
We shall use the highest level library available for websockets available for react and nextjs. please look into this online
Let us use Three.JS to allow for more elaborate 3d animations for a fulfilling user experience.
The backend will be fast api.

Game State & Calculations:
We will represent our game map internall via a grid based data structure. however it is of upmost importance to utilize a grid with very detailed, small boxes, in order to allow for pleasant graphics. in addition we shall optimize the calculations for claiming territory as much as possible to prevent slow gameplay.
The game shall have a tick rate of 30fps.
We shall use approximate grid based calculations for territory, however we will use small block sizes to increase accuracy.
It should be an approximation of a circle, based on our grid.

Player Interaction:
There shall not be a chat
There shall be random assignment of colors, made sure to be unique within the lobby.
No cooldowns or restrictions for making a trail

Game Loop & Performance:
We shall use both RequestAnimationFrame on the client and a setInterval equivalent on the server. The client will handle rendering while the server itself handles all the game logic.
Basic position updates are sufficient for the game
We shall use a multisource bfs, starting from the positions on the newly connected trail. for each direction we will mark the square accordingly based on the direction we are moving (Left, Right, Up, Down). We will maintain a visited set per direction / color. we shall then know if a square is captured, if it has been marked by all four sides. We must stop moving in a direction once we with the edge boundary of the map.

(the x denotes our trail, the h denotes our current territory, the o denotes the other territory, and the C represents the point at which we joined our trail with existing territory)
ooxxxxxo
ooxoooCo
ooxooohh
ooxxxxhh

Once we run our multisource BFS, we will notice that only the 6 o within the x is fully marked. the o on the far left side have only been marked by our Left direction. We then transform our map as so:

oohhhhho
oohoooho
oohooohh
oohhhhhh

We will implement this naively for the time being, and look for future optimizations as the need arises.
We shall maintain 30fps on the client side.

Deployment & Infrastructure:
No hosting requirements.
One global server
No game state persistence.
Basic server logging

UI/UX Details:
We shall follow the player on the frontend display
There shall be no zoom functionality
There shall be a percentage of the territory owned via a leaderboard, but also a minimap visual.
There shall be no tutorial / instructions.

Error Handling & Edge Cases:
In case the user unfocuses the tab, simply continue to move in their last direction.
In case of a temporary drop, the player shall continue to move in the same direction, until eventually being dropped for inactivity (1 minute)
There shall be reconnection.
We shall not handle client side tampering.
